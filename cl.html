<h1><a name="INTRO">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>
This document describes how to build and use <kbd>cl</kbd> v1.4. <kbd>cl</kbd> interprets
a programming language with a lot of similarities to various "Combinatory Logic" (CL)
formal systems. It doesn't exactly interpret any "Combinatory Logic" in that
it runs on computers with finite CPU speed and a finite memory.
Most or all formal systems fail to take these limits into account.
</p>
<p>
Release 1.4 fixes some weird bugs relating to un-reducible subexpressions that
get copied twice, once still un-reducible, but the second (normal order of
evaluation) made reducible.
</p>
<p>
I started writing this interpreter as a way to test the "graph reduction"
implementation of a lambda calculator.  Along the way, I bought a copy
of Raymond Smullyan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mock-Mockingbird-Raymond-M-Smullyan/dp/0192801422/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1226791982&amp;sr=8-3">To Mock A Mockingbird</a>.
I ended up making <kbd>cl</kbd> into
a reasonably complete and usable system, in order to work out that book's problems.
</p>
<p>
<a href="cl/">Another page</a> documents the design and implementation of
an earlier version of <kbd>cl</kbd>.
That document still holds as a good
description of the internals of <kbd>cl</kbd>.
</p>
<h1><a name="STARTING">Starting</a> the interpreter</h1>
<p>
After <a href="#INSTALL">building the interpreter's executable</a>,
you can start it from the command line:
</p>
<pre> 7:57AM 87 % ./cl
CL&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The interpreter uses "<kbd>CL&gt;</kbd>" as its prompt for user input.
<kbd>cl</kbd> has a strict grammar, so you must type in either
(a) a <a href="#GRAMMAR">term</a> for reduction, or an interpreter command,
or a command to <a href="#EXAMINE">examine a term</a>.
</p>
<p>
You have to use keyboard end-of-file (usually control-D) to exit <kbd>cl</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
Giving the interpreter a CL term causes it to execute the
usual functional language interpreter's read-eval-print loop.
The interpreter prints the input in a minimally-parenthesized representation,
reduces to normal form, and prints a text representation of the normal form.
It prints a prompt, and waits for another user input.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>cl</kbd> does "normal order" evaluation: the leftmost outermost expression
gets evaluated first.  This seems like the standard for CL, unlike
for lambda calculus, where a lot of ink gets expended distinguishing between "normal order"
and "applicative order".
</p>

</table>
<p>
The <kbd>-e</kbd> or <kbd>-s</kbd> options have no use without the <kbd>-t</kbd> option, but <kbd>-t</kbd> alone can perform
handy tasks.
</p>
<p>
You can use one or more <kbd>-C <em>combinator</em></kbd> options to confine yourself to a given
basis, or turn off the K combinator to work in &lambda;I calculi.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>-L <em>filename</em></kbd> can occur more than one time. <kbd>cl</kbd> will interpret the files
in the order they appear on the command line.
After the last (or only) file, it prints the <kbd>CL&gt;</kbd> prompt, then waits for interactive
user input.
</p>
<h1><a name="RUNNING">Using</a> the interpreter</h1>
<h2>Interactive input</h2>
<p>
I designed <kbd>cl</kbd> for use as an interactive system, with a user typing
CL expressions at a prompt. The interpreter reduces the expression
to a normal form (if it has one), or hits some other limit, like a pre-set
timeout, count of allowed reductions or the user's patience.
</p>
<p>
The built-in prompt for input is the string "<kbd>CL&gt;</kbd>".
It appears when the interpreter starts up, or has finished reducing whatever
expression the user gave it last, or it has executed an interpreter command.
</p>
<p>
You have to type an end-of-file character (almost always control-D) to quit,
as it has no built-in "exit" or "quit" command.
</p>
<p>
A keyboard interrupt (almost always control-C) can interrupt whatever long-running
reduction currently takes place.  A keyboard interrupt at the "<kbd>CL&gt;</kbd>"
prompt will cause the interpreter to exit.
</p>
<h3>Non-interactive input</h3>
<p>
The <kbd>-p</kbd> command line option causes the interpreter to not print a
prompt. This probably only has use for non-interactive input. The interpreter
does read from stdin and write to stdout. You can use it as a non-interactive
"filter", with input and output redirection.
</p>
<h3><a name="GRAMMAR">Grammar</a>, briefly</h3>
<p>
Expressions consist of either a single term, or two (perhaps implicitly
parenthesized) terms.
Terms consist of either a
<a href="#BUILTINS">built-in primitive</a> or a variable, or a parenthesize
expression.
</p>
<p>
Built-in combinators have names consisting of a single upper-case letter.
Variables (which can also serve as <a href="#ABBREVS">abbreviations</a>)
can look like C or Java style identifiers: a letter, followed by zero
or more letters or underscores.
</p>
<p>
The interpreter treats combinators and variables as "left associative",
the standard in the Combinatory Logic literature.
That means that an expression like this:
<kbd>I a b c d</kbd> ends up getting treated as though it had parentheses
like this: <kbd>((((I a) b) c) d)</kbd>
</p>
<p>
To apply one complex term to another, the user must use parentheses.
Applying <kbd>W (W K)</kbd> to <kbd>C W</kbd> would look like this:
<kbd>(W (W K)) (C W)</kbd>.
</p>
<h3>Parentheses</h3>
<p>
Users can parenthesize input expressions as much or as little as they desire,
up to the limits of left-association and the meaning they wish to convey
to the interpreter.
The grammar used by <kbd>cl</kbd> does not
allow single terms inside paired parentheses. It considers strings
like "<kbd>(I)</kbd>" as syntax errors. You have to put at least two terms
inside a pair of parentheses, and parentheses must have matching counterparts.
</p>
<p>
The interpreter prints out normal forms in minimal-parentheses style.
Users should have the ability to cut-n-paste output back into the input,
as output has valid syntax.  No keyboard shortcuts exist to take advantage
of any previous output.
</p>
<h2><a name="BUILTINS">Built-in Primitives</a></h2>
<p>
I built-in 9 primitive combinators. They reduce like this:
</p>
<table border="0">
	<tr><td align="left"><strong>I</strong> a &rarr; a</td></tr>
	<tr><td align="left"><strong>K</strong> a b &rarr; a</td></tr>
	<tr><td align="left"><strong>S</strong> a b c &rarr; a c (b c)</td></tr>
	<tr><td align="left"><strong>B</strong> a b c &rarr; a (b c)</td></tr>
	<tr><td align="left"><strong>C</strong> a b c &rarr; a c b</td></tr>
	<tr><td align="left"><strong>W</strong> a b &rarr; a b b</td></tr>
	<tr><td align="left"><strong>T</strong> a b &rarr; b a</td></tr>
	<tr><td align="left"><strong>M</strong> a &rarr; a a</td></tr>
	<tr><td align="left"><strong>J</strong> a b c d &rarr; a b (a d c)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This set of built-ins lets you use <kbd>{S, K}</kbd>, <kbd>{S, K, I}</kbd>,
<kbd>{B, W, C, K}</kbd>, <kbd>{B, M, T, K}</kbd> bases for &lambda;K calculi,
or
<kbd>{J, I}</kbd>, <kbd>{B, C, W, I}</kbd> and <kbd>{I, B, C, S}</kbd> as bases for &lambda;I calculi.
</p>
<p>
Built-in combinators require a certain number (one to four) of arguments
to cause a reduction.  They just sit there without that number of arguments.
</p>
<p>
You can "turn off" any of the nine combinators as built-ins with a <kbd>-C <em>X</em></kbd>
command line option (<kbd><em>X</em></kbd> is any of the nine built-in combinators).
No interpreter command exists to turn off or on a combinator during a session.
</p>
<h2><a name="BRACKETS">Bracket Abstraction</a></h2>
<p>
"Bracket abstraction" names the process of creating a CL
expression without specified variables, that when evaluated with appropriate arguments, ends up
giving you the original expression with the specified variables.
</p>
<p>
The <kbd>cl</kbd> interpreter uses the conventional square-bracket
notation.  For example, to create an expression that will duplicate
its single argument, one would type:
</p>
<p>
<kbd>CL&gt; [x] x x</kbd>
</p>
<p>
You can use more than one variable inside square brackets, separated
with commas:
</p>
<p>
<kbd>CL&gt; [a, b, c] a (b c)</kbd>
</p>
<p>
The above square-bracketed expression ends up working through three
bracket abstractions, abstracting <kbd>c</kbd> from <kbd>a (b c)</kbd>,
<kbd>b</kbd> from the resulting expression, and <kbd>a</kbd> from
that expression.
</p>
<p>
A bracket abstraction makes an expression, so you can use them where ever
you might use any other simple or complex expression, defining an abbreviation,
a sub-expression of a much larger expression, as an expression to evaluate
immediately, or inside another bracket abstraction.
For example, you could create Turing's fixed-point combinator like this:
</p>
<pre>CL&gt; <a href="#ABBREVS">def</a> U [x][y] (x(y y x))
CL&gt; def Yturing (U U)
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of nested bracket abstractions.  The abstraction of <kbd>y</kbd>
occurs first, then <kbd>x</kbd> gets abstracted from the resulting expression.
</p>
<p>
You could alternately express <kbd>[x][y] (x(y y x))</kbd> 
as <kbd>[x,y] (x(y y x))</kbd>.  The same nested abstraction occurs.
</p>
<h3>Algorithms</h3>
<p>
<kbd>cl</kbd> offers six bracket abstraction algorithms:
</p>
	<ul>
		<li><kbd>curry</kbd> - classic, minimalistic three-rule system for S,K,I basis.</li>
		<li><kbd>curry2</kbd> - four-rule system for S,K,I basis. Hindley and Seldin's Definition 2.18</li>
		<li><kbd>tromp</kbd> - John Tromp's nine-rule system for compact expressions in the S,K,I basis.</li>
		<li><kbd>turner</kbd> - Simplified Turner algorithm, using S,B,C,K,I combinators.</li>
		<li><kbd>grz</kbd> - the Grzegorczyk algorithm for {B,W,C,K} basis.</li>
		<li><kbd>btmk</kbd> - algorithm for {B,T,M,K} basis.</li>
	</ul>
<p>
You can set a "default" algorithm with the this command:
<kbd>abstraction <em>name</em></kbd>. For <kbd><em>name</em></kbd>, substitute
one of the six algorithm names above.
<kbd>cl</kbd> starts with <kbd>curry</kbd> as the default bracket abstraction
algorithm.
</p>
<p>
You can specify the abstraction algorithm next to the abstracted variable:
<kbd>CL&gt; [x]btmk (x (K x))</kbd>
</p>
<p>
<kbd>cl's</kbd> grammar allows mixing algorithms, one for each
pair of square brackets. The resulting expression may not make any sense.
</p>
<h2><a name="ABBREVS">Defining abbreviations</a></h2>
	<ul>
		<li><kbd>define <em>name</em> <em>expression</em></kbd></li>
		<li><kbd>def <em>name</em> <em>expression</em></kbd></li>
		<li><kbd>reduce <em>expression</em></kbd></li>
	</ul>
<p>
<kbd>define</kbd> and <kbd>def</kbd> allow a user to introduce "abbreviations"
to the input. Each time the abbreviation appears in input, <kbd>cl</kbd> makes a copy
of the expression so abbreviated, and puts that copy in the input.
No matter how complex the expression, an
abbreviation still comprises a single term. Effectively, the interpreter puts
the expanded abbreviation in a pair of parentheses.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>def</kbd> makes an easy-to-type abbreviation of <kbd>define</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
The <kbd>reduce</kbd> command actually produces an expression, just
like a bracket abstraction.  Unlike <kbd>define</kbd> or <kbd>def</kbd>,
you can use <kbd>reduce</kbd> anywhere
an expression would fit, as part of a larger expression, as part of an
abbreviation, or as part of a bracket abstraction.
</p>
<h2><a name="EXAMINE">Information about expressions</a></h2>
	<ul>
		<li><kbd><a name="SIZE">size</a> <em>expression</em></kbd> - print the number of atoms in <em>expression</em>.</li>
		<li><kbd><a name="LENGTH">length</a> <em>expression</em></kbd> - print the number of atoms plus number of applications in <em>expression</em>.</li>
		<li><kbd><a name="PRINT">print</a> <em>expression</em></kbd> - print human-readable representation, with abbreviations expanded, but without evaluation.</li>
		<li><kbd><a name="PRINTC">printc</a> <em>expression</em></kbd> - print <a href="#CANON">canonical</a> representation, with abbreviations substituted, but without evaluation.</li>
		<li><kbd>redexes <em>expression</em></kbd> - print a count of possible reductions in <em>expression</em>, regardless of order of evaluation.</li>
		<li><kbd><em>expression</em> = <em>expression</em></kbd> - determine lexical equivalence of any two expressions, after abbreviation substitution, but without evaluation.</li>
	</ul>
<p>
<kbd>print</kbd> lets you see what abbreviations expand to, without evaluation, as does <kbd>printc</kbd>.
The "=" sign lets you determine <em>lexical</em> equality.  All combinators, variables and parentheses
have to match as strings, otherwise "=" deems the expressions not equivalent.
You can put in explicit <kbd>reduce</kbd> commands on both sides of an "=",
otherwise, no evaluation takes place.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>size</kbd> and <kbd>length</kbd> seem slightly redundant, but authorities
measure CL expressions different ways.  These two methods should cover the
vast majority of cases.
</p>
<h2>Detecting reduction cycles</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><kbd>cycles on|off</kbd></li>
		<li><kbd>detect on|off</kbd></li>
	</ul>
<p>
Some CL expressions end up creating a cycle: <kbd>M M</kbd> or <kbd>W W W</kbd>
or <kbd>B (W K) (W (W K)) (B (W K) (W (W K)))</kbd>.  After a certain number of
reductions, the interpreter ends up with an expression it has already encountered.
If you issue the <kbd>cycles on</kbd> command, the interpreter keeps track of 
every expression in the current reduction, and stops when it detects a cyclical
reduction.
</p>
<p><kbd>detect on</kbd> causes the interpreter to also count and print possible reductions,
regardless of reduction order.  It does "normal order" reduction, but ignores that
for the reduction count. This probably only has use with <kbd>cycles on</kbd>
or <kbd>trace on</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
Turning cycle detection on will add time to an
expression's reduction, as will possible reduction detection.
</p>
<h2>Intermediate output and single-stepping</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><kbd>trace on|off</kbd></li>
		<li><kbd>elaborate on|off</kbd></li>
		<li><kbd>debug on|off</kbd></li>
		<li><kbd>step on|off</kbd></li>
	</ul>
<p>
You can issue any of these commands without an "on" or "off" argument
to inquire about the current state of the directive.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>trace</kbd>, <kbd>debug</kbd> and <kbd>elaborate</kbd> provide
increasingly verbose output. <kbd>trace</kbd> shows the expression
after each reduction, <kbd>debug</kbd> adds information about which
branch of an application it evaluates, and <kbd>elaborate</kbd>
adds to that information useful in debugging memory allocation problems.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>detect</kbd> causes <kbd>trace</kbd> to also print a count
of possible reductions (not all of them normal order reductions),
and mark reducible primitives with an asterisk.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>step on</kbd> causes the interpreter to stop after each reduction,
print the intermediate expression, and wait, at a <kbd>?</kbd> prompt
for user input. Hitting return goes to the next reduction, <kbd>n</kbd>
or <kbd>q</kbd> terminates the reduction, and <kbd>c</kbd> causes it
to quit single-stepping.
</p>
<h2>Reduction information and control</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><kbd>timer on|off</kbd> - turn on/off per-reduction elapsed time output.</li>
		<li><kbd>timeout 0|N</kbd>- stop reducing after <kbd>N</kbd> seconds.</li>
		<li><kbd>count 0|N</kbd> - stop reducing after <kbd>N</kbd> reductions.</li>
	</ul>
<p>
You can turn time outs off by using a 0 (zero) second timeout.
Similarly, you can turn reduction-count-limited evaluation off
with a 0 (zero) count.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>timer on</kbd> also times <a href="#BRACKETS">bracket abstraction</a>.
</p>
<h2>Reading in files</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><kbd>load "<em>filename</em>"</kbd></li>
	</ul>
<p>
You only have to double-quote filenames with whitespace or
non-alphanumeric characters in them.
You can use absolute filenames (beginning with "/") or you can 
filenames relative to the current working directory of the <kbd>cl</kbd>
process.
</p>
<h2><a name="CANON">Canonical Expression Representation</a></h2>
<p>
The <kbd><a href="#PRINTC">printc</a></kbd> command, and cycle detection output
use a canonical form of representing a CL expression.
</p>
<p>
In this case, "canonical" means: pre-order, depth-first, left-to-right traversal of the parse tree,
output of a period (".") for each application, and a space before each combinator or variable.
</p>
<p>A simple application (<kbd>K I</kbd>, for example) looks like this: <kbd>.K I</kbd></p>
<p>A more complex application (<kbd>P R (Q R)</kbd>) looks like this: <kbd>..P R.Q R</kbd></p>
<p>
The advantage to this sort of notation is that every application appears explicitly, and
variant, semantically-equivalent parentheses don't appear.
</p>
<h1><a name="INSTALL">Building and installing</a></h1>
<p>
I developed this program on Slackware Linuxes, v9, 10.1 and 12.0.
I used the C compilers GCC, <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc/">LCC</a>,
<a href="http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/">PCC</a> and <a href="http://bellard.org/tcc/">TCC</a>.
I tried to make it as ANSI-C
as possible by using various compilers, not allowing any compiler warnings
when building, and using as many warning flags for GCC compiles as possible.
</p>
<p>
In addition, I have built it under Redhat linux on a 64-bit "Opteron" system,
and a Solaris 2.9 SPARC-based system under GCC (32 and 64 bit compiles).
I was unable to get HP's ghastly "c89" to compile it - the signal handling
is apparently not ANSI-standard, but there's no way to get ANSI-style function
definitions to compile outside of the "c89" abortion.
</p>
<p>
I expect it will build easily on any *BSD-based system, but I haven't
actually tried that.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Get the source code. You can:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="cl-1.4.tar.gz">Download</a> via your browser.</li>
			<li>Download using wget: <kbd>wget http://www.inlumineconsulting.com:8080/website/cl-1.4.tar.gz</kbd></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Unpack source code.  From the command line: <kbd>tar xzf cl-1.4.tar.gz</kbd>
	</li>
	<li>Change directory.  From the command line: <kbd>cd cl-1.4</kbd>
	</li>
	<li>Compile source code. From the command line: <kbd>make gnu</kbd>.<br/>
	That target ("gnu") should work for almost every linux or BSD computer.
		Other make targets might work better. <kbd>make cc</kbd> uses 
	traditionally-unix-named tools, and may work better on Solaris.
	Traditional, AT&amp;T derived <kbd>lex</kbd> will require a minor edit
	to file <kbd>lex.l</kbd>
	</li>
	<li>At this point, you can test the newly-compiled executable.
	From the command line: <kbd>./runtests</kbd>.  Most of the tests should
	run quite rapidly, in under a second.  At least two of the tests run
	for 30 seconds or so, and at least one of the tests deliberately provokes
	a syntax error message from the interpreter.
	</li>
	<li>Install the interpreter if you want, or you can execute it in-place.
	To install, use the <kbd>cp</kbd> or <kbd>mv</kbd> commands to move or
	copy the executable to where ever you want it.  It does not care what
	directory it resides in, and it does not look for configuration files
	anywhere.
	</li>
