# "Line" reduction graphs, as per JW Klop's "Cycles in 
# Combinatory Logic Reduction", section 3(?)
# BCWK basis, perhaps the easiest to get a "line"
# reduction graph out of.

# Two terms with "line" reduction graphs.
# F F y -> F F (K y)

count 20

# Makes an infinite series of C-combinator prefix
W W (B (B C) W)

# all-W line, in BWCK:
W W (W W)
# Can't do an all-M line, but an all-S line works.
# What about an all-A line in OAME or AMEN?

# Another line, executes alternating Bs, Ws
# B W W a b  -> a b b b
# a = B W W, b = B W W
# after B W W reduces, you have:
# B W W (B W W) (B W W) (B W W)
# Every 3 head reductions leaves  (B W W) suffix
# that does not include a redex.

B W W (B W W) (B W W)
