# Check a problem that occurs only with  the 2nd of two
# copied arguments - they wouldn't get executed, even
# if they had enough arguments.  Not a problem with
# any given combinator's code, however, nor a problem with
# the abstraction algorithm or the duplicating combinator.
# The idea here is to use M, W, or S to create a duplicated
# (ie dual-linked) sub exression, (S a b) in this:
# a (S a b) ((S a b) c)
# M, W, S just create a reference to the duplicated
# sub-expression.  The bug involved looking at the
# left-most (S a b).  S has 2 args, cannot reduce.
# in (S a b) c , S has 3 args, should reduce, but did not.
